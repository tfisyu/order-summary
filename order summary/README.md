## My process

I took an entire afternoon doing this. Seems a lot easy for most people, but for me, who's just starting coding, it's a challenge that I'm up to put my entire days until I see the result I want. I saw some videos to help me a little bit, for example the responsive parts; but 90% of it was made all by myself and my acknowledge until then.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me a lot about some doubts I had around backgrounds (images, repeat, size, etc). And I'm proud that I made the buttons fast!

### Continued development

I intend to continue focusing on learning about spacing and making better use of flexbox. I didn't use grid here but I want to dominate it as soon as I can.
